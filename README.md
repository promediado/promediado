## About Me

I'm a 16 year old programmer from Peru/USA, I speak both Spanish and English fluently. My goal is always to learn new things and help people reach their goals.

## 🔧 Languages I know

Here are some of the languages I know and can help with:

- Python 🐍: Around 2-3 years learning this language and always looking to learn new things, specially bots.
- C# 🌟: Around 3-4 years learning this language, making automation software and external assists.
- C++ 🖥️: 1-2 years experience, I found this project kind of complicated, however, always looking to learn it and master it.
